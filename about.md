Hi! I am Chinmay.

Quick facts about me: I am 26 years old, currently staying in Bangalore, working at a startup. I was born in Udaipur, brought up in Delhi. I studied in Kanpur, lived in Mumbai for a year, and then moved to Bangalore.

I am always looking to squeeze in a trip - long or short. Mostly short, as that's what work permits.

I hope you find the posts useful. Happy travels!
