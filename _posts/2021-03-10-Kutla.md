Kutla is a tiny village about 2 hours from Tosh, accessible only on foot, with a waterfall at the midway. It's actually got only ~10 houses, all comfortably spaced out. Very few people know about it, and fewer decide to visit. I preferred Kutla to Tosh, since it does have a few Tosh-like cafes / camps, and additionally offers the peace that eludes Tosh.

**Things I didn't do:**
- Glacier Point

## Tips and Resources
- Carry a few things to eat as there are not many good quality restaurants in the area, and it will most likely be a long day
- If you are the type who doesn't realise how much time has gone by at a spot, you will definitely get delayed, since all the spots are magnificent. Hence, factor in some extra time for the trip
