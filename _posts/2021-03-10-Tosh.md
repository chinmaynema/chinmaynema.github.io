<span style="color: #000000">**Day 1: Kasol, Chalal, Hike to Tosh**</span>

- I departed at 8am from Manali by cab and reached Kasol in 2 hours
	-   Its a scenic route along the river, first Beas and then Parvati
	-   While the Beas valley is broad, the Parvati valley is very narrow, and hence the river gushes with more force

## Tips and Resources
- Since there are so many places in Chikmagalur, prioritise basis your interest, time and conveyance
- Chikmagalur is famous for homestays in coffee estates, or even at other places. If you have your own vehicle, this is worth exploring
- To the above itinerary, if you want to hasten things, you can add one more place to both the days (out of Baba Budangiri, Kemmangundi, Hebbe Falls)
- Mullayangiri trek starts from Sarpadhari (marked in the map). It's an easy, short trek, taking ~3hours while scaling up, hence definitely recommended
- If you plan to trek, itâ€™s best to wear a cap, apply sunscreen and carry sufficient water
