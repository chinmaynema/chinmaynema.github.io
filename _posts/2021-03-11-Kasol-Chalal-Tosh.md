<span style="color: #000000">**Day 1: Kasol, Chalal, Hike to Tosh**</span>

- I departed at 8am from **Old Manali** by cab and reached **Kasol** in 2 hours
	-   Its a scenic route along the river, first Beas and then Parvati
- Kasol town was just opening up, and I decided to spend some time on the banks of the **Parvati river**
	-   While the Beas valley is broad, the Parvati valley is very narrow and winding, and hence the river gushes with more force
	-   I had been advised by some of my Himachali friends that there is not much in Kasol, hence I decided to move on

</p>

- Next stop was **Chalal**, a beautiful, tiny hamlet on the other side of the river
	- Its a 40 minutes hike to Chalal, through the forest, along the river. There are several peaceful spots on the way to squat
	- Chalal is popular for psychedelic / trance parties in the deep forests, visited by world-renowned DJs
	- I headed straight to **Freedom Cafe**, a psychedelic themed cafe, for a scrumptious meal. There was one such party being hosted by them that night
- After roaming around Chalal for a while, I headed back to Kasol, to catch the bus to **Barshaini**
	- There are buses every hour from Kasol to Barshaini, till ~4pm
	- Again, a picturesque route, as you head higher up the mountains, leaving the crowd and the traffic behind
- The weather was pleasant and I decided to hike up to **Tosh**, crossing the **Parvati Dam** on the way
	- Its ~3.5 kms on a winding road, unmetalled at times, with amazing views of the valley
	- If you request the security at the dam, they may allow you to walk on it. Unfortunately, when I went, the river was running dry
- I checked-in to the **Pink Floyd Cafe** for the remaining hours of the day
	- Whenever I travel solo, I prefer not to book a hotel beforehand so that I can explore the area first and find the most suited one
	- Pink Floyd Cafe is one of the most popular hotels in Tosh, located in the main tourist area, just above the local houses. They have a trippy cafe with good food and vibe
	- I spent the evening at the cafe, reading Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck, taking in the splendid valley view and the cafe vibes
	- One amazing thing about Tosh was that everyone instantly becomes a friend! All the travellers come with an open mind and heart and gel together

<span style="color: #000000">**Day 2: Tosh Waterfall, Kutla**</span>

- It was a lazy morning, with mellow music and a slow breakfast. But once done, I headed out for a day-long hike to the Tosh waterfalls and Kutla village
	- Please check out this post on <a href="https://onetriptoanother.com/Kutla">Kutla</a> for more details about this day trip. I think you must definitely include it in your itinerary

## Tips and Resources
- Since there are so many places in Chikmagalur, prioritise basis your interest, time and conveyance
- Chikmagalur is famous for homestays in coffee estates, or even at other places. If you have your own vehicle, this is worth exploring
- To the above itinerary, if you want to hasten things, you can add one more place to both the days (out of Baba Budangiri, Kemmangundi, Hebbe Falls)
- Mullayangiri trek starts from Sarpadhari (marked in the map). It's an easy, short trek, taking ~3hours while scaling up, hence definitely recommended
- If you plan to trek, itâ€™s best to wear a cap, apply sunscreen and carry sufficient water
