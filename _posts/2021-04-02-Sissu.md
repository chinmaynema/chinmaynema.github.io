Sissu is a tiny village about 2 hours from Tosh, accessible only on foot, with a waterfall at the midway. It's actually got only ~10 houses, all comfortably spaced out. Very few people know about it, and fewer decide to visit. I preferred Kutla to Tosh, since it does have a few Tosh-like cafes / camps, and additionally offers the peace that eludes Tosh.

## Tips and Resources
- Carry a few things to eat as there are not many cafes on the way, especially during the off season
