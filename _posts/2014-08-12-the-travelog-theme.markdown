<p>I was in Chennai for a Visa interview on a Friday morning and then had the rest of the day, plus the weekend to myself. I had to be back in Bangalore by Sunday night, and hence could not travel very far. Mahabalipuram was an obvious choice - it&rsquo;s ideally located 1.5 hours from Chennai, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has vibrant beach cafes. I needed no other reasons to head to Mahabalipuram, though I did end up discovering more!</p>
<p><strong>Duration and Time of Visit</strong></p>

<p>Ola Outstation and Uber Intercity are easily available from Chennai to Mahabalipuram and back. It&rsquo;s a beautiful drive along the Bay of Bengal - starts with the Marina Beach, followed by a splendid coastline interspersed with lakes and pretty cafes. And before you can manage to get bored, Mahabalipuram is there!</p>

<p>Whenever I travel solo, I prefer not to book a hotel beforehand so that I can explore the area and find the most suited one, keeping in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity to the spots I want to visit, since I travel on foot when alone</li>
<li>Security, since I definitely don&rsquo;t want to end up in a suspicious neighbourhood</li>
<li>Access to the bus / train station (either close-by or having some readily available means of transportation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, on reaching Mahabalipuram, I deboarded the cab at one end of the beach (at the Shore Temple) and went hotel-hopping on foot. I realised that the main part of Mahabalipuram Beach was extremely crowded, and hence went in the opposite direction (north). There were a couple of resorts (albeit shabby), costing ~Rs. 5K per room per night. Since I didn&rsquo;t want to spend that much, I went to the hotels next to them. I felt Seashore, Santana and Kalo&rsquo;s had decent rooms - and chose to stay at Seashore. It had a modest room with a beautiful sea-facing view and a rooftop cafe, costing ~Rs. 2K per night. If luxury is what you are looking for, you have Radisson, Welcome Group, Taj resorts as well, all further north.</p>
<p><strong>Time in Mahabalipuram - Itinerary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 1: Chilling at beach cafes, swimming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I checked-in to my hotel around 1 pm</li>
<li>Being March, the Sun was bright, and hence the first thing I did was to take a shower!</li>
<li>I headed straight to the rooftop cafe, ordered some food and drinks and spent the afternoon with a book and some solemn music</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful sea, a sparse beach (being a Friday), soothing wind, a pretty cafe, an intellectually stimulating book and slow music. What more could I have asked for!</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s what more I could have asked for: less Sun and a more beautiful beach! The beach had some litter and many fishing boats anchored haphazardly. That said, I think it was definitely better than most Indian beaches - the water was clean, land not as dirty and good crowd (less in quantity, sensible in quality)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As the Sun set, I decided to go in for a swim</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>I like to just lay in water. Try this whenever you are in water next (sea or a pool) and if you know swimming - float on your back with your ears underwater. You are able to hear the water and it cancels the rest of the background noise. It&rsquo;s one of the most calming and relaxing sensations I have experienced!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Late evening, I went to Radisson for dinner</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a beautiful property. They have a gorgeous restaurant by the beach (which is ~0.5 kms from the entrance! Hence they have golf carts to ferry people)</li>
<li>I spent about 5 hours there, again in the company of my book and some good African music, slowly eating a delicious vegetarian Lasagna and sipping my drink</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I walked back, all set for the sunrise the next day</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2: Exploring the monuments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Sun rises at ~5:45 am (in March beginning). I got up in time to see it rise through my window. Luckily, the sky was kind enough to be clear that day</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When I finally woke up for good, I was starving. Sri Anand Bhavan happened to be close-by and a recommended restaurant for a heavy vegetarian meal</li>
<li>Around 1 pm, I headed to the main attraction of Mahabalipuram - the famous archaeological monuments</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>There are three separate complexes with some monuments within each</li>
<li>A single ticket (Rs. 30 for Indians; Rs. 500 for foreigners) allows you entry to all three complexes</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Itinerary for the monument visit:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I planned to visit the largest complex first, then the Pancha Rathas and finally the Shore Temple, which is by the sea, hence offering a great view to relax after the tiring day</li>
<li>Largest complex (1.5-2 hours):</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>I entered from Krishna&rsquo;s Butterball side and exited from the Lighthouse side, which is closer to the second complex</li>
<li>There are several excavated temples and structures, and thankfully, direction-signs to guide you</li>
<li>But still, I felt there was a need to follow Google Maps, so as to not miss any site. For eg. Arjuna&rsquo;s Penance and Krishna Mandapa are accessible from the road and not from within the complex</li>
<li>Highlights: I liked Krishna&rsquo;s Butterball, Arjuna&rsquo;s Penance, Mahishasuramardini the most - the former for its magnificence, the latter two for their intricate details</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pancha Rathas (20 minutes):</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>This is about 800 m away from the Lighthouse exit of the first complex</li>
<li>It has 5 beautiful <em>rathas</em> made of rock, named after the five Pandavas</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shore Temple (20 minutes):</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about 1.5 kms from the Pancha Rathas - so I took an auto-rickshaw</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a beautiful temple complex with lawns around it and the sea in front of it</li>
<li>I stayed here till the sunset</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><em>(For more information about the monuments, you can refer to the links posted at the end)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>On my way back, I came across a Kerala massage centre and decided to unwind after the tiring day</li>
<li>Finally, I returned to the hotel, took a shower and headed to the beach cafe of Sea Breeze Resort for dinner, again with the same old company of my book</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It was an average restaurant, with basic ambience, menu and service</li>
<li>However, the weather and the view made up for everything else :)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3: Long walk on the beach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having woken up to a lazy morning - sitting on my balcony, casually watching the people on the beach - around 9 am, I decided to go for a walk on the beach. I plugged in my headphones and started walking north of my hotel</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Mornings at the beach are amazing! The weather is ideal, wind is perfect, sand is soft and cool - it is serene and joyful</li>
<li>I walked for about 1.5 kms, seeing on the way, other tourists calmly walking along, happy kids playing in the water, some locals catching fish / shells, beautiful resorts and a dead turtle washed ashore, all the while listening to soothing music</li>
<li>People ask me what I like about solo trips. I don&rsquo;t think these trips provide me a gateway for introspection particularly; just being with oneself in the present and figuring out things on one&rsquo;s own is surprisingly refreshing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Post that, I spent the rest of the morning at the rooftop cafe, till ~1 pm, when I took a cab to Chennai (Ola / Uber to the rescue again)</li>

Travelog is a theme for Jekyll that is both elegant and downright simple.

In addition to being devilishly handsome, it is responsive down to mobile and has a very light footprint. Travelog lends itself well to photography and travel journaling.

Like a backpack with too many straps, a blog can sometimes be frustrating when it has too many bells and whistles. It is with that philosophy that I have put together this theme so that you might drown in its whitespace.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/885x500" />
    <p class="post-image-caption">Using a little bit of markup, you can add beautiful captions to your totally beautiful pictures. Amazing.</p>

    		Expanding on this, you can show two images side-by-side

    	<span class="post-image-caption-right">
    		And even define separate captions for each.
