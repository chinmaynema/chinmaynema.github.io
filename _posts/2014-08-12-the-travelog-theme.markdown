I was in Chennai for a Visa interview on a Friday morning and then had
the rest of the day, plus the weekend to myself. I had to be back in
Bangalore by Sunday night, and hence could not travel very far.
Mahabalipuram was an obvious choice - it’s ideally located 1.5 hours
from Chennai, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has vibrant beach
cafes. I needed no other reasons to head to Mahabalipuram, though I did
end up discovering more\!

**Duration and Time of Visit**

3 days, 2 nights

March beginning

**To and From**

| **Route**    | Chennai - Mahabalipuram - Chennai |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Mode**     | Cab                               |
| **Duration** | 1.5 hours either way              |
| **Cost**     | Rs. 1,000 - 1,500 one way         |

Ola Outstation and Uber Intercity are easily available from Chennai to
Mahabalipuram and back. It’s a beautiful drive along the Bay of Bengal -
starts with the Marina Beach, followed by a splendid coastline
interspersed with lakes and pretty cafes. And before you can manage to
get bored, Mahabalipuram is there\!

**Stay**

| **Hotel**             | Seashore Hotel                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**              | Rs. 2,000 per night                                   |
| **Best area to stay** | On the Mahabalipuram beach, north of the Shore Temple |

![](media/image2.png)

Whenever I travel solo, I prefer not to book a hotel beforehand so that
I can explore the area and find the most suited one, keeping in mind:

  - > Proximity to the spots I want to visit, since I travel on foot
    > when alone

  - > Security, since I definitely don’t want to end up in a suspicious
    > neighbourhood

  - > Access to the bus / train station (either close-by or having some
    > readily available means of transportation)

Hence, on reaching Mahabalipuram, I deboarded the cab at one end of the
beach (at the Shore Temple) and went hotel-hopping on foot. I realised
that the main part of Mahabalipuram Beach was extremely crowded, and
hence went in the opposite direction (north). There were a couple of
resorts (albeit shabby), costing \~Rs. 5K per room per night. Since I
didn’t want to spend that much, I went to the hotels next to them. I
felt Seashore, Santana and Kalo’s had decent rooms - and chose to stay
at Seashore. It had a modest room with a beautiful sea-facing view and a
rooftop cafe, costing \~Rs. 2K per night. If luxury is what you are
looking for, you have Radisson, Welcome Group, Taj resorts as well, all
further north.

**Time in Mahabalipuram - Itinerary**

**Day 1: Chilling at beach cafes, swimming**

  - > I checked-in to my hotel around 1 pm

  - > Being March, the Sun was bright, and hence the first thing I did
    > was to take a shower\!

  - > I headed straight to the rooftop cafe, ordered some food and
    > drinks and spent the afternoon with a book and some solemn music
    
      - > A beautiful sea, a sparse beach (being a Friday), soothing
        > wind, a pretty cafe, an intellectually stimulating book and
        > slow music. What more could I have asked for\!
    
      - > Here’s what more I could have asked for: less Sun and a more
        > beautiful beach\! The beach had some litter and many fishing
        > boats anchored haphazardly. That said, I think it was
        > definitely better than most Indian beaches - the water was
        > clean, land not as dirty and good crowd (less in quantity,
        > sensible in quality)

![](media/image8.png)

  - > As the Sun set, I decided to go in for a swim
    
      - > I like to just lay in water. Try this whenever you are in
        > water next (sea or a pool) and if you know swimming - float on
        > your back with your ears underwater. You are able to hear the
        > water and it cancels the rest of the background noise. It’s
        > one of the most calming and relaxing sensations I have
        > experienced\!

  - > Late evening, I went to Radisson for dinner
    
      - > It’s a beautiful property. They have a gorgeous restaurant by
        > the beach (which is \~0.5 kms from the entrance\! Hence they
        > have golf carts to ferry people)
    
      - > I spent about 5 hours there, again in the company of my book
        > and some good African music, slowly eating a delicious
        > vegetarian Lasagna and sipping my drink

![](media/image13.png)

  - > I walked back, all set for the sunrise the next day

**Day 2: Exploring the monuments**

  - > The Sun rises at \~5:45 am (in March beginning). I got up in time
    > to see it rise through my window. Luckily, the sky was kind enough
    > to be clear that day

![](media/image6.png)

  - > When I finally woke up for good, I was starving. Sri Anand Bhavan
    > happened to be close-by and a recommended restaurant for a heavy
    > vegetarian meal

  - > Around 1 pm, I headed to the main attraction of Mahabalipuram -
    > the famous archaeological monuments
    
      - > There are three separate complexes with some monuments within
        > each
    
      - > A single ticket (Rs. 30 for Indians; Rs. 500 for foreigners)
        > allows you entry to all three complexes

<span class="underline">Itinerary for the monument visit:

  - > I planned to visit the largest complex first, then the Pancha

    > offering a great view to relax after the tiring day

  - > Largest complex (1.5-2 hours):
    
      - > I entered from Krishna’s Butterball side and exited from the

      - > There are several excavated temples and structures, and
        > thankfully, direction-signs to guide you
    
      - > But still, I felt there was a need to follow Google Maps, so
        > as to not miss any site. For eg. Arjuna’s Penance and Krishna

      - > <span class="underline">Highlights:</span> I liked Krishna’s

      - > This is about 800 m away from the Lighthouse exit of the first
        > complex
    
      - > It has 5 beautiful *rathas* made of rock, named after the five

  - > Shore Temple (20 minutes):
    
      - > It’s about 1.5 kms from the Pancha Rathas - so I took an
        > auto-rickshaw
    
      - > It’s a beautiful temple complex with lawns around it and the
        > sea in front of it
    
      - > I stayed here till the sunset

  - > On my way back, I came across a Kerala massage centre and decided

        > service
    
      - > However, the weather and the view made up for everything else
        > :)

**Day 3: Long walk on the beach**

    > casually watching the people on the beach - around 9 am, I decided
    > to go for a walk on the beach. I plugged in my headphones and

      - > Mornings at the beach are amazing\! The weather is ideal, wind

      - > I walked for about 1.5 kms, seeing on the way, other tourists
        > calmly walking along, happy kids playing in the water, some

Travelog is a theme for Jekyll that is both elegant and downright simple.

In addition to being devilishly handsome, it is responsive down to mobile and has a very light footprint. Travelog lends itself well to photography and travel journaling.

Like a backpack with too many straps, a blog can sometimes be frustrating when it has too many bells and whistles. It is with that philosophy that I have put together this theme so that you might drown in its whitespace.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/885x500" />
    <p class="post-image-caption">Using a little bit of markup, you can add beautiful captions to your totally beautiful pictures. Amazing.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-image post-image--split">
    <a href="#">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/435x500" />
    </a>
    <a href="#">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/435x500" />
    </a>
    <p class="post-image-caption">
    	<span class="post-image-caption-left">
    		Expanding on this, you can show two images side-by-side
    	</span>
    	<span class="post-image-caption-right">
    		And even define separate captions for each.
    	</span>
