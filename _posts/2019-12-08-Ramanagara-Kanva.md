Who wouldn't get excited on knowing that Sholay was shot just 60 kms away from Bangalore? We sure did! One fine weekend, my flatmate and I decided to go on a short, relaxed roadtrip to Ramanagara, where the famous hill on which Gabbar once sat is located. Only unfortunately, my friend wasn't feeling well on the day of the trip and had to bail out. I decided to march on.

## Itinerary

**Ramanagara:**

- I picked up my car from the Drivezy hub in Bellandur around 8 am, and dashed out of the town
- I drove till the NICE Ring Road Toll Booth in a single shot and as is customary for all our road trips in that direction, stopped at the Udupi Gardenia right after that to have a good South Indian breakfast
	- It is best to escape the traffic early morning and stop only after crossing the city boundaries
- From there, I drove straight to the Ramadevarabetta Vulture Sanctuary in Ramanagara, where Sholay was shot
	- I wasn't aware that this is the only vulture sanctuary in India, setup only recently in 2012
	- In case you face any issues locating the sanctuary, look out for a huge statue of Lord Hanuman - that's the road to take
	- There is an entry fee of Rs. 25 which includes parking
- From the parking, there is a hike of about 40 minutes to the top of the hill
	- It's an easy climb, a combination of steps and grass. Although, for senior citizens, it may become a bit tiring by the end
	- The route is dotted with tiny temples every 10 minutes or so

</p>

- Around the midway, comes the biggest and the most famous temple of Lord Ram in the area
	- It's a lively place, with some crowd around, sermons playing on speakers, prasad being served
	- Beyond the temple, the path becomes a bit tedious and the view becomes a bit gorgeous

</p>

- For the final ascent, there is a small tricky stretch with steps cut into the rock, that may look a bit scary to some, but don't worry - there are hand rails along, and the rock is not slippery at all. This brings you to the summit!
	- It's a beautiful view from the top with barren rocky hills all around
	- These hills are very different from the usual ones we see or imagine, giving a very raw and badass feel to the place - exactly like Sholay!
	- You can spot vultures from the top: There are two varieties of vultures in these areas: Egyptian and Indian. I was lucky to bump into a birdwatching enthusiast, who lent me his binoculars

</p>
- I took a round of the small hill top to check out the views from all angles and finally chose a spot I liked
	- I switched on my speakers, took out my Kindle, and I was in my zone :)
	- I had some snacks and drinks with me, hence not requiring a lunch
	- I spent about 4 hours there, seeing the weather change from harsh sunshine to cloudy / breezy to drizzling
	- That's when I accepted it was time to go back - not a good idea to get stuck alone in the rain, that too on a hill, even though I did have an umbrella

</p>
- I managed to reach the bottom in about 15 minutes, but by now, it had stopped raining - so I decided to go to the closeby Kanva Dam!

**Kanva Dam:**

- It took me about 30 minutes and about 5 direction-requests to reach the dam (somehow Google points you inside the reservoir!)
	- It was a bit dampening to find out that the dam was closed to public and people could only look at it from a spot on the road
	- I had time on hand, so I decided to figure out a way to get closer!

- I drove a little further and found a road going next to the dam. From that road, I saw a shepherd feeding his sheep on the slopes of the dam! I asked him how to reach there, parked the car on the roadside and climbed to the top of the dam
	- Being alone on a dam is one of the most amazing feelings: alone, in front of a vast water body, which is totally calm, held together by a wall of rock, on which you stand. I have had this opportunity some times now and always look forward to it
	- I walked the length of the dam, till the time I could see the people on the road, who were looking at me on the dam! ;)
	- Again, I chose a good spot and took out my kit - speakers and Kindle
	- I got a guest in some time, in the form of a vulture, who came and sat on the light pole next to me - keeping me busy photographing it for a good 15 minutes

- After about an hour there, I got up to drive back to Bangalore, in time to hand back my car


## Major Expenses

## Tips and Resources

- As expected, the network is a bit patchy towards the top of the hill
- It can be very sunny and since there are only few trees, it's best to wear a cap, apply sunscreen and carry sufficient water
- Do carry an umbrella, especially during the monsoon or extreme sunshine
