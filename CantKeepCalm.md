**Yes? No?**<br><br>

To be or not to be?<br>
To shake the status quo, or no?<br>
How will we ever know?<br>
What will it take to say yes and go?<br><br>

While we answer these questions,<br>
And understand oneself and the other,<br>
I am definitely proud of what we have now,<br>
What we have achieved and what we have become.<br><br>

Looking back at a younger me,<br>
A lot of edges rounded by you,<br>
You've been harsh, you've been gentle,
 <br><br>

The hundred things you hate about me,
Are the next set of things I am ready to work on,


----------------------------------------------<br><br>

**The World's Your Oyster**<br><br>

While I may say this every year,<br>
Really hoping the best for you this time dear.<br>
As you take decisions that define your life,<br>
Hoping for strength, confidence, luck on your side.<br><br>

Be a badass, shine on,<br>
Get all the love,<br>
Look your best,<br>
Be where you want.<br><br>

You have what it takes,<br>
Ask for what you want,<br>
Listen to your heart,<br>
Be who you are.<br><br>

I can't stress enough,<br>
How amazing you are.<br>
Don't be too self-critical,<br>
Look at yourself from someone else's eye for once.<br><br>

Lots of love to you sweets.<br><br>

------------------------------------------------<br><br>

**The cutie I love!**<br><br>

To the cutie I love,<br>
Who deserves the best.<br><br>
I want to celebrate you,<br>
Cause you bring me meaning and joy.<br><br>
And I am ever thankful,<br>
That you exist :)
