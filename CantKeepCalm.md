<!--<br><br>
<!------------------------------------------------<br><br> -->
While I may say this every year,<br>
Really hoping the best for you this time dear.<br>
As you take decisions that define your life,<br>
Hoping for strength, confidence, luck on your side.<br><br>

Be a badass, shine on,<br>
Get all the love,<br>
Look your best,<br>
Be where you want.<br><br>

You have what it takes,<br>
Ask for what you want,<br>
Listen to your heart,<br>
Be who you are.<br><br>

I can't stress enough,<br>
How amazing you are.<br>
Don't be too self-critical,<br>
Look at yourself from someone else's eye for once.<br><br>

Lots of love to you sweets.<br><br>

The cutie I love!
<br><br>

To the cutie I love,<br>
Who deserves the best.<br><br>
I want to celebrate you,<br>
Cause you bring me meaning and joy.<br><br>
And I am ever thankful,<br>
That you exist :)
